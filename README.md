# Visualising CQC Ratings across England in RShiny
## Introduction
This is a collection of code to visualise CQC ratings in England compared to region funding and funding per capita. 

## Running the Code
The code doesn't seem to run currently - it used to run previously but I'm unlikely to revisit this project to check

## Some pictures of what it should look like

## Next Steps
* None - This work was for a university project and would be better being rewritten in Python Flask for future development.
